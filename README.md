## 📋 About The Project

This repository is a collection of various scripts and mini-applications developed while learning the **C programming language** at **Coda**. It serves as a personal sandbox to test logic, mathematical formulas, and system-level concepts.

The repository covers a wide range of topics, from simple calculators to more complex systems like RPG mechanics or memory management drills.

> **Specific Goal:** Building a solid foundation in procedural programming by solving diverse algorithmic challenges (Games, Tools, and Data Manipulation).

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Mastered

Through these various exercises, I have explored and implemented:

* **🎮 Game Logic & Simulation:** Creating interactive programs like a "Juste Prix", a basic "RPG" engine, or a "Bataille" game.
* **🧮 Mathematical Algorithms:** Implementing tools for "IMC" calculation, "TVA" processing, and finding "Maximum/Moyenne" in datasets.
* **🏗️ Advanced Data Structures:** Working with "Tableau 2D", "Pointeurs", and "Liste Chainée" (Linked Lists).
* **🛠️ Practical Utilities:** Building a "Calculatrice", "Palindrome" checkers, and "File" management systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **C Language (C99/C11)** | Core implementation for all exercises. |
| **GCC** | Main compiler for building the binaries. |
| **Make (Makefile)** | Automation of compilation for larger sub-projects. |
| **Valgrind** | Memory profiling to ensure leak-free code. |

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized into several modules, including:
- `RPG/` & `Juste_prix/`: Game development logic.
- `Pointeurs/` & `liste_chaine/`: Memory and data structure drills.
- `Calculatrice/` & `TVA/`: Practical tool implementations.
- `Tableau_2D/` & `Moyenne/`: Array and matrix manipulation.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/kenzotrindade/C-Working.git](https://github.com/kenzotrindade/C-Working.git)
2. Navigate to a specific project folder (e.g., RPG):
   ```bash
   cd C-Working/RPG
3. Compile (if a Makefile exists) or use GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o my_program
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./my_program
